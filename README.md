# Mapzen Metro Extracts

This was a service for providing city-sized chunks of OpenStreetMap data in a variety of geographic data file formats. It's no longer operating.

## Alternatives

- [Interline OSM Extracts](https://www.interline.io/osm/extracts/) provides extracts for these 200 metro regions (and a few more that have been added since) in PBF, GeoJSON and GeoJSON Lines format. Free. Updated daily.
- [Nextzen Metro Extracts](https://metro-extracts.nextzen.org/) provides extracts for these 200 metro regions in the exact same formats as Mapzen Metro Extracts. Free. Updated once (in May 2018).
- [Learn OSM](https://learnosm.org/en/osm-data/getting-data/) provides a guide to other ways of getting OpenStreetMap data.
