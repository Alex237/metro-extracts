subtitle: Country, region and city boundary data from OpenStreetMap, served monthly
introduction: |
  <p>
    Each country link contains a zipped directory of geojson files, each describing increasingly detailed administrative boundaries. The hierarchy varies by country but in the United States, admin layer 2 describes the national boundary, layer 4 is states, layer 6 is counties, and layer 8 is cities. The OSM wiki has specifics for each country.
